# dw_matrix_car
Predictions of car prices - implementation of more advanced ML techniques.

Space connected with "Matrix - Transformacja" project, being a introduction and knowledge base for ML topics.

Transformation part 2 consists of 5 tasks:
- creating a meta file,
- visualisations of acqired dataset,
- predictions of car prices based on sklearn Decision Tree Regressor,
- predictions of car prices based on sklearn Random Forest Regressor, incorporating feature engenieering,
- predictions of car prices based on xgboost library with hyperopt hyperparameter optimization.
